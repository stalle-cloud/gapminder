# Report on New Insights on Poverty


## Introduction
This report shows trends in world health and economics using data visualization, exploratory data analysis and summarization. The original data are from Gapminder https://www.gapminder.org. The results will show how actual trends in health and economics contradict the narratives that emanate from sensationalist media coverage of catastrophes, tragedies, and other unfortunate events.

## Data Visualization

### Life expectancy versus fertility rate
This pair of scatter plots shows how life expectancy versus fertility changes among countries from 1962 to 2012.

This shows a trend that the majority of countries went from having large families and short lifespans to having smaller families and longer lifespans.
